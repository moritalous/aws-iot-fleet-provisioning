# Consuming sample, demonstrating how a device process would leverage the provisioning class.
#  The handler makes use of the asycio library and therefore requires Python 3.7.
#
#  Prereq's: 
#      1) A provisioning claim certificate has been cut from AWSIoT.
#	   2) A restrictive "birth" policy has been associated with the certificate.
#      3) A provisioning template was created to manage the activities to be performed during new certificate activation.
#	   4) The claim certificate was placed securely on the device fleet and shipped to the field. (along with root/ca and private key)
#  
#  Execution:
#      1) The paths to the certificates, and names of IoTCore endpoint and provisioning template are set in config.ini (this project)  
#	   2) A device boots up and encounters it's "first run" experience and executes the process (main) below.
# 	   3) The process instatiates a handler that uses the bootstrap certificate to connect to IoTCore.
#	   4) The connection only enables calls to the Foundry provisioning services, where a new certificate is requested.
#      5) The certificate is assembled from the response payload, and a foundry service call is made to activate the certificate.
#	   6) The provisioning template executes the instructions provided and the process rotates to the new certificate.
#      7) Using the new certificate, a pub/sub call is demonstrated on a previously forbidden topic to test the new certificate.
#      8) New certificates are saved locally, and can be stored/consumed as the application deems necessary.
